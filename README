Newsletter-Grabber
==================

What is this?
-------------

This is a simple (at present) script to grab newsletter lists
and/or other data which will need to be queried from our databases
for marketing, development, and other purposes.

Traditionally, IT Operations has manually had to query these
databases and often request the correct SQL from the developers to
extract this data. This script is intended to simplify matters by
doing it automatically.

Usage
-----

newsletter.rb sitename

Configuration
-------------

At the moment, this script will take an argument on the command line
stating which site - configured in its config.yaml - we care about, 
running whichever queries are listed there with the credentials given.
Therefore, to add a query to it, add a block of yaml thus:

generic-site:
  name: 'Generic forum'
  host: localhost
  database: genericforum
  user: newsletter
  password: password
  query: "SELECT foo FROM bar WHERE blee = '1'"
  type: mysql

This should be relatively self-explanatory. The name value is for
readability only; it isn't used except in debug output. The top-level
value is the sitename used as an argument to run the script; so, in
this case, running newsletter.rb generic-site will run this query.

WARNING: The query will be parsed literally and with no sanity checking
whatsoever. It is your and the developer's responsibility to ensure it
is safe. I would recommend creating a specific user for newsletter
collection with SELECT privileges only.

This code at the moment outputs directly to STDOUT. I will add file
saving shortly.
